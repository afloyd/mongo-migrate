#mongo-migrate
####NPM: mongodb-migrate
=============

Built starting with a framework from: https://github.com/visionmedia/node-migrate


## Installation
	$ npm install mongodb-migrate

##Usage
```
Usage: node mongodb-migrate [options] [command]

Options:
	-runmm, --runMongoMIgrate		Run the migration from the command line
	-c, --chdir <path>				Change the working directory (if you wish to store your migrations outside of this folder
	-cfg, --config <filename>		DB config file name
	--dbn, --dbPropName <string>		Property name for the database connection in the config file. The configuration file should
									contain something like
									{
										appDb : { //appDb would be the dbPropName
											host: 'localhost',
											db: 'mydbname',
											//port: '27017' //include a port if necessary
										}
									}

Commands:
	down [revision]		migrate down (stop at optional revision name/number)
	up [revision]		migrate up (stop at optional revision name/number)
	create [title]		create a new migration file with optional [title]
```

##Command-line usage
NPM will install `mongodb-migrate` into a `node_modules` folder within the directory it is run. To use `mongodb-migrate` from the command line, you must always specify the relative path from your current directory to the `mongodb-migrate` directory for `node` to be able to find it. Such as: `node .\node_modules\mongodb-migrate -runmm create` (shown in examples below), or on *nix machines `node ./node_modules/mongodb-migrate -runmm create`.

##Creating Migrations
To create a migration execute with `node .\node_modules\mongodb-migrate -runmm create` and optionally a title. mongodb-migrate will create a node module within `./migrations/` which contains the following two exports:
```
var mongodb = require('mongodb');

exports.up = function (db, next) {
	next();
};

exports.down = function (db, next) {
	next();
};
```

All you have to do is populate these, invoking `next()` when complete, and you are ready to migrate! If you detect an error during the `exports.up` or `exports.down` pass next(err) and the migration will attempt to revert the opposite direction. If you're migrating up and error, it'll try to do that migration down.

For example:

```
	$ node .\node_modules\mongodb-migrate -runmm create add-pets
	$ node .\node_modules\mongodb-migrate -runmm create add-owners
```

The first call creates `./migrations/0005-add-pets.js`, which we can populate:
```
exports.up = function (db, next) {
	var pets = mongodb.Collection(db, 'pets');
	pets.insert({name: 'tobi'}, next);
};

exports.down = function (db, next) {
	var pets = mongodb.Collection(db, 'pets');
	pets.findAndModify({name: 'tobi'}, [], {}, { remove: true }, next);
};
```

The second creates `./migrations/0010-add-owners.js`, which we can populate:
```
	exports.up = function(db, next){
		var owners = mongodb.Collection(db, 'owners');
		owners.insert({name: 'taylor'}, next);
    };

	exports.down = function(db, next){
		var owners = mongodb.Collection(db, 'owners');
		pets.findAndModify({name: 'taylor'}, [], {}, { remove: true }, next);
	};
```

Note, for mongodb 2.x you need to use `db.collection('<collection-name>')` instead of `mongodb.Collection(db, '<collection-name>')`.

## Running Migrations
When first running the migrations, all will be executed in sequence.

```
	node .\node_modules\mongodb-migrate -runmm
	up : migrations/0005-add-pets.js
	up : migrations/0010-add-owners.js
	migration : complete
```

Subsequent attempts will simply output "complete", as they have already been executed on the given database. `mongodb-migrate` knows this because it stores migrations already run against the database in the `migrations` collection.
```
	$ node mongodb-migrate -runmm
	migration : complete
```

If we were to create another migration using `node .\node_modules\mongodb-migrate -runmm create coolest-owner`, and then execute migrations again, we would execute only those not previously executed:
```
	$ node .\node_modules\mongodb-migrate -runmm
	up : migrations/0015-coolest-owner
```

If we were to then migrate using `node .\node_modules\mongodb-migrate -runmm down 5`. This means to run from current revision, which in this case would be `0015-coolecst-owner`, down to revision number 5. Note that you can use either the revision number, or then full revision name `0005-add-pets`
```
	$ node .\node_modules\mongodb-migrate -runmm down 5
	down : migrations/0015-coolest-owner
	down : migrations/0010-add-owners
```

## Configuration
### Working Directory
The options for connecting to the database are read in from a file. You can configure where the file is read in from and where the migration directory root is by the `-c <path>` option.
```
	$ node .\node_modules\mongodb-migrate -runmm -c ../.. up
	migration : complete
```
This would set the working directory two levels above the mongodb-migrate directory, such as if you included it into another project and it was nested in the node_modules folder.

### Config filename
The default configuration filename is `default-config.json`. If you wish to use a different filename, use the `-cfg <filename>` option:
```
	$ node .\node_modules\mongodb-migrate -runmm -cfg my-config.json up
	migration : complete
```

### Config file property name
Inside the configuration file, mongodb-migrate expects the database connection information to be nested inside an object. The default object name is `mongoAppDb`. If you wish to change this you can use the `-dbn <string>` option:
```
	$ node .\node_modules\mongodb-migrate -runmm -dbn dbSettings up
	migration : complete
```
This would tell mongodb-migrate your config file looks something like:
```
	{
		dbSettings: {
			host: 'localhost',
			db: 'myDatabaseName',
			//port: 27017 //Specifying a port is optional
		}
	}
```
To connect to a replica set, use  the `replicaSet` property:
```
	{
		dbSettings: {
			replicaSet : ["localhost:27017","localhost:27018","localhost:27019"],
			db: 'myDatabaseName',
		}
	}
```
or use `connectionString` property:
```
	{
		dbSettings: {
			connectionString: 'mongodb://user:password@mongo1.host.com:27018,mongo2.host.com:27018,mongo-arbiter.host.com:27018/?w=majority&amp;wtimeoutMS=10000&amp;journal=true'
		}
	}
```
`connectionString` has priority over the other properties

All of these settings can be combined as desired, except for the up/down obviously ;)
